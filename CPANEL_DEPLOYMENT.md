## Current Configuration Status

**âœ… READY FOR DEPLOYMENT ON CPANEL WITH NODE.JS 16.20.2**

The project builds successfully and all components are compatible.

## cPanel Deployment Steps

### 1. Upload Files
Upload all project files to your cPanel file manager or via FTP.

### 2. Set Node.js Version
In cPanel:
- Go to "Node.js Selector" or "Node.js"
- Select version 16.20.2
- Set the application root to your project directory

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Build the Application
```bash
npm run build
```

### 5. Start the Application
```bash
npm start
```

### Alternative: Use the deployment script
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

## Environment Variables for cPanel

Create a `.env.production` file with:
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
```

## Important Notes

- The server listens on `0.0.0.0` to work with cPanel's networking
- Port is automatically detected from environment variables
- Custom server.js is used instead of `next start` for better cPanel compatibility
- Turbopack is disabled for compatibility

## Troubleshooting

### If you get module errors:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### If TypeScript errors occur:
The project uses TypeScript 4.9.5 which is compatible with Node.js 16. If you encounter issues, try:
```bash
npm run build -- --no-lint
```

### Port Issues:
cPanel typically assigns a specific port. Check your cPanel Node.js settings and update the PORT environment variable accordingly.
