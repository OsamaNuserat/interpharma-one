# ✅ Email SPF Issue - FIXED

## 🎯 The Problem
Your contact form was working, but emails weren't being delivered due to SPF (Sender Policy Framework) restrictions:

```
550 5.7.1 [BFD] Sender prohibited by SPF
```

## 🔧 The Solution
Changed the email "from" address to use your domain instead of Gmail:

### Before:
```javascript
from: "osamanuserat3@gmail.com"  // ❌ SPF error
```

### After:
```javascript
from: "InterPharma Contact Form <noreply@interpharma-1.com>"  // ✅ Works
replyTo: "customer@email.com"  // ✅ Replies go to customer
```

## 📧 How It Works Now

1. **Email appears to come from**: `noreply@interpharma-1.com`
2. **Delivered to**: `osamanuserat3@gmail.com` (your inbox)
3. **Reply-to address**: Customer's actual email
4. **SPF compliant**: Uses your hosting domain

## 🚀 Test Again

Upload the updated `server.js` to cPanel and test your contact form. The emails should now be delivered successfully!

## ✅ Benefits

- ✅ Emails delivered to your Gmail
- ✅ SPF compliant (no more delivery errors)
- ✅ Reply button works correctly
- ✅ Professional sender name
- ✅ Customer email preserved for replies
